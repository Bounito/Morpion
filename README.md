The game is on-line : [http://svaret.free.fr/Morpion/](http://svaret.free.fr/Morpion/)

- The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
- You are Blue , the computer is Red . Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
- The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
- When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
- The computer set out a report about his reasoning...

Have fun !
